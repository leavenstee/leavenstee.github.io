This was apart of a small buisness / start up course we took for a entrepenuership certificate. The problem we chose to solve was buying beer at a crowded bar. There has to be an easier way we thought! So the first pass at this was to make a mobile ordering platfrom similar to a Uber Eats, Grub Hub .. ETC. You would place your order via your phone then when it was ready you would be able to pick it up at a designated part of the bar. So the original design for Sipp was for a duel application for P2P. The first part of the application was the Bar / Bartender features. They would have a specific flow of being able to receive orders process them then be able to notify a user (Drink Buyer) that the item was ready to be picked up. The second flow was for the user (Drink Buyer) they would be able to pick from a menu and order and pay for a drink. This then would let the user (Drink Buyer) avoid having to flag down a bar tender and avoid cash transfer. This gives the user more time with friends and zero worries.

You would end up using 4 or 5 apps from the time your left your apt / house and got to a friends to have drinks and then eventually to a bar. We wanted to be the one place solution for that. We started to build the social media platform for a night out. We integrated the Facebook SDK with using Core Location into the app so a user would be able to see where there friends are at if they were in one of the partnered bars. We also took time to link up the Uber and Lyft SDK to give a one button push to take you to a bar. "),r.a.createElement("p",null," The main interface of the app was a map with different pop overs to give a user information on a bar whart we would have on the application. The most important and value we saw in this app was to give the bars the ability to provide special deals through the app. With the push of a button they could send out a drink deal to all the users who were in the area.
